    <p>My thoughts</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Charlatan</h3>
    <p>There are truths that people will listen to only if you blatantly lie.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Sisyphean</h3>
    <p>The collective existence of beings is the epitome of it.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Observer</h3>
    <p>“Any AI smart enough to pass a Turing test is smart enough to know how to fail it.” – Ian McDonald</p>
    <p>The same goes for humans.</p>
    <p>Any human smart enough to ace a test is smart enough to know how to fail it.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>My beliefs on science</h3>
    <p>If something cannot be explained through science,</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5vh">it just means science isn’t advanced enough to prove it yet.</p>
    <p>Nothing is unknowable. Time is the limit.</p>
    <p>Everything can, and will, be proven through science.</p>
    <p>Bigfoot, ghosts, aliens.</p>
    <p>Even God and the end itself.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Reality</h3>
    <p>"The real world is much smaller than the imaginary" - Nietzsche</p>
    <p>but (the true nature of) reality is much bigger than you may think.</p>
    <h3>Dream</h3>
    <p>If I stopped making games, one of my dreams is to work in VR and AI.</p>
    <p>Of course, a huge part of that is because of Sword Art Online.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5vh">When I was small, I once watched a video of a woman, Jan Scheuerman, using her brain to move an artificial arm.</p>
    <p>I've always thought that could be implemented in the sector of games.</p>
    <p>Playing games solely through your brain is one of the first steps in dive tech, that's what I think at least.</p>
    <p>I would first start with a simple mario-like platformer game that would be played entirely hands-free, solely through thinking.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5vh">After optimizations and reducing the burden the brain needs to play, I would start looking into dreams.</p>
    <p>If I'm not wrong, what is needed in dive technology would be found in researching the brain when one dreams.</p>
